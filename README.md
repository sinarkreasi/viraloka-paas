# Viraloka PaaS

### Build Scalable SaaS on WordPress CMS Self-hosted

Viraloka is a lightweight Platform-as-a-Service layer designed for builders who want structure, scalability, and long-term control.
It transforms WordPress into a modular, multi-tenant, event-driven application engine — without turning your system into a performance nightmare.

## Why Viraloka?

Most WordPress-based SaaS projects fail not because of ideas but because of architecture.

Viraloka gives you:

* A clean modular foundation
* Clear separation of core and features
* Workspace & multi-tenant readiness
* Billing-aware architecture
* Event-driven extensibility

You don’t patch plugins together.
You build systems.

---

## Designed for Builders

Viraloka is not a typical plugin.
It is a structural layer that allows you to build:

* SaaS products
* Internal platforms
* Automation systems
* Multi-client dashboards
* Digital services infrastructure

All powered by a unified core.

## Core Architecture Highlights

Future-proof architecture.

### Workspace & Tenant Ready

Every execution is isolated.
Built for multi-tenant SaaS from day one.

### Event-Driven System

Trigger actions across modules safely and predictably.
No spaghetti hooks.

If you think in systems — Viraloka fits.
